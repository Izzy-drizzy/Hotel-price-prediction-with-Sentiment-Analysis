Thank you Valentin for the wonderful latte and smile
He was polite and very attentive deliver a more personal touch to the service priceless",5,Jul-24,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"i would rate this 3 out of 4 but no more the location is good though being next to the station some rooms get noise from train announcements Double glazing and aircon meant that it was ok with windows closed though the rooms remained rather too warm overnight and this was in moderate weather Breakfast was good Rooms were clean and staff very helpful Like other reviewers we would have liked a room fridge. The decor is dated and the en suite shower room was an odd prefabricated pod with a mediocre shower flow fan permanently on and a noisy door Check in desk very oddly and awkwardly placed in bar area
This is not a budget hotel and as far as we could see not the cheapest for the location For the price we expected a bit more I would not rule out staying here again but I will probably try elsewhere next time",3,Jul-24,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"Lucília and Team make this cafe the most enjoyable, cosy, comfortable place in town! The service is 5 star, the atmosphere is great and the goodies delicious.

8,"You can actually see this hotel as you exit from the central station. It is also about a 15 minute walk into the central quarters of the city

Our room had creative interior decoration, a desk, comfortable beds and was clean. Bins for waste and recycling were provided in the hallway. A green policy was advertised for towels, but it appears all towels were changed anyway. There was no in-room safe, fridge, or gym. The reception kindly agreed to store some medication in their fridge.",4,Jul-24,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"Love this place! The food is always great food weather breakfast, lunch or dinner. All the drinks are fresh. Love the caramel iced latte. Staff always friendly, smiley and polite.

10,"This hotel is in a great location next to the train station and a bunch of cafes and restaurants. It’s only a short walk into central Cambridge too.

The room was perfectly fine, cleaned every day and tea and coffee always topped up. The only ‘issue’ was the loud bathroom door which was problematic with a sleeping baby.

The staff really make this hotel. The check in, cleaning and cafe staff are all wonderful. The ladies in the cafe were particularly helpful with our baby providing entertainment and helping feed her (high chair and warming up food). Our baby was always so happy to see them too, so they must be good people ;-) unfortunately I didn’t get their names but one has a little sister called Luna :-)",5,Jul-24,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"Situated near the train station, bus station, and essential stores, this location is very easy and convenient. With reasonable prices, it remains quiet despite its proximity to the train station, thanks to the building's excellent architectural design that blocks out all noise.",5,Jul-24,Booking.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,"Breakfast was pretty good, but the juice wasn’t nice at all, very weak. Hotel handy for the station, but quite a walk into town. Room was clean and tidy. But strange only having one bedside table! Bathroom was spotless. Staff were friendly.  There was some confusion over my Accor membership at check in. But was resolved.

22,"A very comfortable, friendly and convenient hotel close to station. We were visiting Cambridge four four nights by train and were looking for a fairly central spot to stay. The Ibis was ideal. Close to station might sound a bad choice but not in Cambridge. The station square has some of the ambience of a pedestrian piazza. Several cafes, a Sainsburys and a bar / pizzeria present in the Ibis and next door. There is a very small reception area where we were welcomed warmly and efficiently. There is a bar reastaurant and a fairly small lounge area (with occasional live music) And upstairs a large breakfast room with excellent varieties of foods and beverages. The rooms are fairly typical Ibis , small but beds are vry comfortable with pillows to enjoy! The ensuite toilets and showers were in ""pods"" within the roome and were interesting . I would note that there is a mall step up (two inches or so ) to get into the ensuite which was a bit of a surprise when I went to visit at night half asleep. I dont know if anyone has ever tripped on this!. The staff were fantastic with personality and humour. Thank them all! Great stay in convenient reasonably priced hotel!",5,Jul-24,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,"I’m a repeater customer here. The staff are friendly (personally thanks especially to Vero:)) and very welcoming.

27,"We came for dinner and were served by Kelly, Inês, and Filipa. As always, the customer service was exemplary- they not only made us feel welcome as usual (we are regulars) but were incredibly attentive while dealing with an impressive workload! I can only say that they all deserve a raise and are brilliant staff. The IBIS is lucky to have such an impressive crew and I hope will recognise this. Special shout-out to Melissa as well who was not serving tonight but is a superstar and has been a key to making our previous visits so smooth.",5,Jun-24,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A special shout out to two of them, the wonderful Melissa in the bar who could not be more helpful and friendly and the equally wonderful Susana in reception. They always remember us when we come to stay and the level of service they provide is phenomenal. Thanks to both of them and their fellow excellent colleagues for making us feel so welcome and our regular stays so enjoyable.

43,"It's always a nice experience to spend time in the cafe at ibis Cambridge. It is a nice place with a wide variety of food, drinks, coffee and pleasant staff. Huge thanks to Melissa and Antia for their hospitality and smiles. They always make our day!",5,Jun-24,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,"We chose this place because it was well located for train travel and it had a good price. Do note that it is a little bit out of town. Its a longish walk or a bus ride in. However, you get exactly what you expect for an Ibis. Because I'm a hotel member, I was able to store my luggage when I arrived early. The front desk staff were having to do a lot of explaining to other people that this facility wasn't an option open to them unless they joined the loyalty scheme.

Hotel is convenient to several cafes if you're not having breakfast in house.

Room was fine, compact as Ibis always is but with everything needed there. Surprisingly, given the hotel was full, it was actually pretty quiet so slept well. Only annoying thing was a fluoro light constantly flickering so we had to turn it off.

Otherwise, a good stay with good value for money and very convenient to the train the next day.",5,Jun-24,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,"The room was clean and modern and excellent location for the train station. I would like a fridge in the room and the ability to order room service from downstairs instead of going down to the bar. Staff aren’t the friendliest. Also think the tea and coffee facilities could be improved in the room, especially for the price you pay.",3,Jun-24,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,"Very convenient as its near the train station. Check in was good. The Rooms are clean and comfortable. The staff, Filipa, Ines and Antia are very friendly and attentive.

47,"My friend just arrived cambridge yesterday, I took her walk around cambridge and we took a break and spent sometime and chatting in Chill#2 cafe, we ordered one latte and one mocha the price kind of expensive but it was fine, the area was very chill as same as the coffee shop name, also we met two very kind and polite staff which is Val and Melissa. Both of them gave us a warm welcome with big smile, Melissa also made both of us very pretty and taste very smooth latte with pretty latte art and smooth Mocha with a lot chocolate powder on top. We will definitely come here again!!",5,Jun-24,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

49,"By the Rail station, great location, clean rooms, lovely and kind staff, especially Kelly on the bar and lady at the reservation desk.

50,"Couldn’t be more convenient for the railway station; food and drink options on the doorstep but only a short walk away from some nice pubs and cafes on Mill Road.
Quite expensive for one night without breakfast, but probably our fault for staying in graduation week (we didn’t know when we booked!)",4,Jul-24,Booking.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,"We liked the location, the beds, and seatings in the bedroom, which allowed us to put things separately. The decor is new and clean. The hotel offered luggage storage after checking out if you are registered as an Accord member. The reception was very helpful.
The carpet is a bit dark, which makes the room dark even with lights on. The bathroom is a bit small but it's OK for our one night stay.",4,Jul-24,Booking.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

56,"The staff were really friendly and helpful with my queries. The room was quiet and outside noise was barely heard. My room was comfortable and the wi-fi worked without issue. It is conveniently located next to the station and has some food places to eat if you do not want to eat in their café. I really liked the café as a place to relax when I was not outside.

59,"Great Location, Clean, compact but functional.
Friendly helpful staff. Free bag drop facility.
Very uncomfortable bed. Obviously this is a matter of opinion but for reference my partner and I are about 5'10"" and about 10 stone, side sleepers. Only 1 pillow each which although large was like a brick once compacted. We usually like a firm mattress but this bed was very hard with a 1"" mattress topper in an attempt to mitigate the hard divan style bed but you could still feel hard ridges in the mattress through it. There was no point complaining as we were only staying one night.

No idea why there are not more complaints about Ibis 'sweet' beds so maybe we just got unlucky....",4,Jul-24,Booking.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast offered a wide variety of choices and was excellent.",5,Jun-24,Booking.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,"I’d not stayed in an Ibis hotel before. The room I had was of a reasonable size with a comfortable bed, practical desk and chair and plenty of storage. There was air con though I did not need it. The only feature of the room I did not like was the bathroom pod. Whilst perfectly serviceable, it was rather cramped in contrast to the rest of the room and I was woken one night by the sound of water gushing and bubbling up underneath the shower as if it was backing up/overflowing. I was worried what I’d find in there in the morning - though actually it was fine.

Breakfast in the hotel was perfectly good with plenty of choice. I particularly liked the diced fresh",4,Jun-24,Booking.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First off the waitress taking the order did not apply the offer advertised and we very politely asked if she could rectify it. She seemed pretty annoyed and gave a distinct eye roll.
We then we waited 15 minutes and had not received our order. I noticed the waitresses chit chatting and our coffees remained cold by the machine. When my partner asked for our coffees explaining he had a train to catch the server exchanged very obvious smirks with the person she was chatting with (not sure if she worked there but the whole thing was unprofessional ) and gave us our by now cold coffees. Very unpleasant attitude and cold coffee. Thanks for ruining my morning. Will not return.",1,Jan-24,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
103,"Great service indeed, nice and peaceful environment with all essential facilities! Thanks Lucilia!

The café area is really peaceful and great place to grab a coffee and work! Food is also really good, try the pizzas, they're really good!!",5,Feb-24,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
104,"Stayed here with my partner. Very welcoming staff, clean room and bathroom. Absolutely nothing wrong with anything here. They have great free WiFi and a good menu of food with a bar and café downstairs. Let us leave our luggage there for the day after we checked out for free which was so helpful. Definitely would come back if I was visiting again",5,Feb-24,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We had breakfast, lunch and dinner there and it was really great. I recommend it.`",5,Mar-24,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
107,"Very welcoming, friendly reception team. Clean, comfortable room and very quiet despite the central location (I was worried it would be noisy and it was one of the quietest hotels I have been to recently). I would stay there again. Only change I would make would be to have marmelade with chunky orange pieces rather than the one they had for breakfast - everything else was great.",5,Mar-24,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
108,"A welcoming, easy stay, with a great cafe and a great room. A lovely touch was being given a flower for international women's day. I actually ate in the cafe, first time ever at a hotel cafe.

109,"This hotel is right by the train station so very conveniently located with buses very close to take you to the city centre or a 1 mile walk into town. There’s a handy Sainsbury’s next door and some eateries.
The staff was helpful on check in. We didn’t eat at the hotel. The room was small (we were 3 people) but clean. The bathroom was cramped and weirdly shaped (and whitewashed) like the cylindrical toilets on trains. Our sink was stained which was a bit off-putting.
But other than that, cheap and cheerful and so if you’re looking for a budget stay, you can’t really go wrong.",4,Mar-24,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
110,"Very central, right next to the station. Lovely decor, beautiful bar and sitting area. Friendly reception staff. Lovely room, nice bathroom pod and area for clothes. Ironing board and iron which was very handy.

120,"Excellent option to stay in Cambridge. The system is a little particular since, instead of having a typical reception, you have hotel staff on the ground floor who checks you in and assigns you the room. But it is an effective and agile system that poses no problems. As for the hotel, it is modern, new, with spacious and clean rooms, without carpet and with a very comfortable bed. The location is, in my opinion, good. Next to the train station, allowing you to leave your suitcase as soon as you arrive, and about 10/15 minutes walk from the center of Cambridge in a pleasant walk. The surroundings of the hotel and the station are very good, with restaurants, a supermarket and office buildings. And all this at a reasonable price, taking into account the high prices you find in Cambridge. Come on, in my opinion, a highly recommended option.",5,Jan-24,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
121,"This is without doubt one of the best ibis hotels I have stayed in.

Nice cafe/bar area on the ground floor.",5,Jan-24,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We spent two nights here and were quite pleased with it. Staff were helpful and the room rate was competitive - unlike other hotels in Cambridge

There was also a great choice at Breakfast in a breakfast room on the 2st floor overlooking the station square",4,Jan-24,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
123,"A few confusions at check-in, but otherwise everything was okay. The 5the floor room was good with a nice view of Cambridge. I liked the closeness to the railway station.

129,"Convenient for the station, less so for city centre (20 min walk or 5 min bus ride). Staff very pleasant and helpful. Informal check in without a reception area worked ok. Pleasant cafe to sit in on ground floor (definitely above usual standard for hotels of this level). There are some other pleasant cafes nearby too. Room adequate - a bit shabby but clean (they need to redecorate soon), also rather noisy as the internal insulation is not great. Price on a Monday in November was a bit high for what one gets - if you have to pay £100 its worth looking for an alternative in the town centre. Otherwise the only complaint was that I left my phone charger in my room and by the time I came back to collect it a few hours later it had disappeared, presumably thrown away by the cleaning staff - poor service.",3,Nov-23,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

144,"This would is a fairly typical contemporary Ibis conveniently located adjacent to the railway station, but a 20-minute walk, or a 5-minute bike ride into the CBD. Reasonably-priced for the UK, this property does not have any serious issues, but we hated the lack of a proper reception desk for check-in. Uncomfortably, we felt we were always in the way in front of someone trying to navigate within the hotel. This is especially awkward when we or other patrons had baggage on hand. What was management thinking?! The friendly employees here on more than one occasion expressed the dislike of the lack of a reception area. Otherwise, it delivers on the basics: cleanliness throughout, good room temperature controls, noise levels under control, reasonably comfortable bed, good toilet pressure and water temperature controls in the bathroom, sufficient supply of towels, nice lighting options in the room, enough electrical outlets to charge your piles of modern junk, workable wi-fi, competent housekeeping, and friendly and helpful staff. Having breakfast buffet over the station plaza was nice.",3,Oct-23,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The check-in out process is efficient and smooth. The room is clean, spacious and the bed comfortable in a cozy quiet atmosphere.

I was welcomed at the hotel and quickly given my key cards. No waiting. no queues!

I went straight to my room and found it to be very clean, bright and completely functional. It had everything I needed. Very important for me, my room was completely silent. No noise from other guests.

Breakfast was good. No nonsense.

The stay was fantastic and represented great value for money.",5,Oct-23,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
148,"Great well priced and well positioned if you need to get the train to newmarket for the horses. Also vicinity wise 10 minutes walk to the left there is the leisure complex with restaurants, cinema and bowling. then straight infront main high street into centre with loads of pubs and restaurants. Hotel Staff were also really welcoming and friendly.

Car parking out the front and cost us £37.50 from 2pm Friday until we left at 11am on Sunday. Their 24 hour period starts from 4am in the morning which means having to pay more than a normal hourly car park. Closest one so no real choice.

Also last thing watch out driving to hotel as our sat nav took us down a bus only lane which we didn't know we were entering until after we went through it as too busy concentrating looking for the car park and not the signs.",5,Oct-23,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reception staff was very friendly and accommodating. The room was small, but very clean and functional. There was even a place to put your suitcase on.

The bed was very comfortable and spacious. The partially open closet was practical and thanks to the shelves, it was easy to put clothes there.

There was even a desk, also with power outlets. The water boiler would benefit from a good cleaning and descaling.

The bathroom was small, but also very clean. The one thing was the water pressure. This was totally inadequate, both from the faucet, as well as the shower. Guests with long hair, better think twice before using shampoo. It may take a long time to get rid of it.

I did notify the reception about this, and it was said that somebody would take a look at it, but I did not notice any difference. Maybe it is just the way it is.

The breakfast buffet was a pleasant surprise. Lots of choices and it was kept well stocked.

Overall, it's a typical Ibis experience, no frills but fully functional and efficient, with a more comprehensive breakfast than some.

202,"Stay at an Ibis anywhere and generally you know you're going to get a good, solid and consistent experience, all at a reasonable price. This one is no exception. Location is handy. Rooms are on the small side but comfortable, and room air conditioning is a nice luxury in a country where despite climate change bringing more hot days, many hotels still have no aircon. Staff were all pleasant and helpful. Breakfast buffet fine apart from rubbery scrambled eggs. We stayed three nights.",4,Jul-23,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
203,"I cannot express enough how exceptional my experience was at IBIS Cambridge, and it's all thanks to the invaluable assistance provided by Clare. As a returning guest, I have always cherished my stays at this hotel due to its unparalleled convenience, being located right next to the train station, and its unbeatable value for money. The vibrant and lively coffee shop downstairs adds to the overall delightful ambiance, and the modern, well-equipped rooms are perfectly suited to my needs.

Nevertheless, my most recent visit stands out because of the impeccable service I received from Clare, the night manager at IBIS. On the 16th of July, I arrived at the hotel, only to realize to my dismay that I had mistakenly booked my stay for the 16th of August instead. Adding to my anxiety, it was a non-refundable reservation for a nine-day stay that I had already paid for. The thought of losing hundreds of pounds and having to rebook at full cost was distressing.

In my state of worry, I shared my predicament with the front desk staff, and Sussane demonstrated remarkable understanding and compassion. She advised me to book for one night while suggesting that I sort out the situation with Viki, the General Manager, the following morning. However, before Viki even had the chance to address my concern, Clare took it upon herself to resolve the issue that very night. She managed to change my reservation to the original intended dates, without any additional charges!

I am utterly grateful to Clare, Viki, and the entire IBIS team for going above and beyond to assist me in this challenging situation. Their promptness, empathy, and efficiency turned what could have been a stressful ordeal into a seamless and pleasant experience. Clare's exceptional customer service truly saved the day, reaffirming my appreciation for the hospitality provided by IBIS Cambridge. I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a delightful stay, as the staff's dedication to guest satisfaction is truly second to none.",5,Jul-23,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
204,"Staff member Lucilia made our stay much more pleasant, with her friendliness, professionalism and availability, I suggest a salary increase. Being an excellent professional management and her entire team. She helped me both at reception and in the breakfast room. Clean and new hotel.",5,Jul-23,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
205,"I have stayed at many hotels closer to town over the years t double to $ and booked here only because the rest were booked out. Have to say , it was the best decision I made. This hotel is so nice, not for the frills of others but clean, friendly great location near train station and buses to town centre. Chilli Bar downstairs good for food and coffee special mention to Paul there for great customer service !",5,Jul-23,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
206,"We enjoyed our stay, friendly staff, easy check in, clean room and good location.

207," Really enjoyed our stay at the Ibis. It is right next to the train station which was perfect to drop our bags off as soon as we arrived. The rooms were clean and fairly spacious. Breakfast had a really good selection of continental and traditional and was served in a comfortable room overlooking the train station. There are also a couple of nice bars next to the hotel where we enjoyed evening drinks. The staff were very helpful and welcoming. Only thing to note is that it's about a 25 min walk into central Cambridge, but a nice walk so we didn't mind.",5,Jun-23,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
208,"I used to really enjoy it, however, I find sometimes the staff can be rude, for example, I found my drink to be very strong and simply asked if more milk could be added ( considering it cost £4.10 I thought this a fair request ) however they refused and said that they would not do this, this was upsetting due to how expensive the latte was.",1,Jun-23,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The window couldn't be opened which I understand for safety reason, although a little bit lack of fresh air. The biggest problem is the hot water from shower wasn't warm at all, just slightly better than cold water. And it could be only opened for half amount.I guess maybe due to control of use of water, but the temperature wasn't warm enough at all. So I took an awful shower that night. Strangely, the tap water for the basin can be very warm, which is ok.",3.5,May-24,Booking.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

215,"The hotel is right next to the Station which is very nice if you arrive late at night. It is a fair but very do-able walk if one is visiting the University, with lots of lovely bakeries and coffee shops along the way. The room was very nice and clean. The decor is minimalist but the design is very clever. They happily stored our luggage for us after we had checked out, until we left on the train later in the day.
The in-house eating offering did not really appeal to us but there are quite a few eating places in the square around the hotel - however, many of these were closed by the time we arrived quite late at night.",4,May-24,Booking.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Breakfast was very good and so were the hotel staff, we parked in the Leisure car park (about a 10 min walk) where you get a discount if you’re staying at the Ibis. You need to ask for the car park discount code when you check out, you then scan it when you’re paying at the car park. Would stay here again.",5,Jun-23,TripAdvisor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Staff were helpful and friendly and check in & check out was very quick and efficient. We had a room on the 4th floor - very clean with tea & coffee making facility, hairdryer, great TV and comfy bed. The bathroom was a bit different - bit like being on a cruise ship as it was more of a ""pod"" than an actual room. That said it had good toiletries and nice towels although we thought the shower was a bit basic. We feel it could have done with a separate hand towel though as once you'd used both bath towels you had to keep using damp towels until the next day! The restaurant staff were excellent - nothing was too much trouble. Plenty of food choices at the breakfast buffet but depending what time you arrived some of the hot food was a bit lukewarm.
